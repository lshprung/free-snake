This is a simple ncurses snake game written in C

-- Compilation Instructions --

$ ./configure
$ make

The resulting binary will be created in src/

-- Creating deb package --

Build the dist archive, and move it up one directory. ARCHIVE will be something like `simple-snake-0.1.tar.gz`

$ ./configure
$ make dist
$ mv ARCHIVE ..

Rename the project directory to match the ARCHIVE (i.e., if ARCHIVE is `simple-snake-0.1.tar.gz`, rename the project directory to `simple-snake-0.1`)

Now, update the `debian` directory and build

$ debmake -e EMAIL -f FULLNAME
$ debuild

The resulting package will be created in the same directory as ARCHIVE was placed

-- Creating rpm package --

If this is your first time building an rpm package:

$ rpmdev-setuptree

Now, build the dist archive, and move it to SOURCES. ARCHIVE will be something like `simple-snake-0.1.tar.gz`

$ ./configure
$ make dist
$ mv ARCHIVE ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

Copy the spec file to SPECS

$ cp simple-snake.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

Build the package

$ rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/simple-snake.spec

The resulting package will be created under `~/rpmbuild/RPMS`
